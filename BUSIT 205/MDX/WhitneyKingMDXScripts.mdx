-------Select Statement Template---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
/*
SELECT
{ } ON Columns,  -- Axis 0
{ } ON Rows		 -- Axis 1
FROM { }
WHERE ();
*/

-------First simple MDX statement--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SELECT										-- Count of total book sales
{ [DimStores].[Store].[Store] } ON Columns	-- Displays one column of sales per store name
FROM [CubePubsSales]
GO

-- This statement could have worked without the 'ON Columns' line, however I wanted to
-- ensure that I made an effort to differentiate my simple MDX statement from the most
-- basic one learned in the examples. This is useful info, but could be more useful if
-- we were to drill deeper down into the breakdown of sales numbers.

-------Second more complex MDX statement-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SELECT													 -- Count of total book sales
{ [DimStores].[Store].[Store] } ON Columns,		         -- Displays one column of sales per store name
{ [DimTitles].[Publisher].[Publisher] } ON Rows  -- Displays one row for each publisher
FROM [CubePubsSales]
GO

-- This statement will display a grid that builds off the previous statement by adding 
-- one row of sales totals for each publisher by bookstore. We run into some annoyances
-- with how information is displayed however, as some publishers haven't sold any books,
-- we can't see when they were sold.

-------Third even more complex MDX statement---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SELECT																 -- Count of total book sales
{ [DimStores].[Store].[Store] } ON Columns,							 -- Displays one column of sales per store name
{ NonEmpty( CROSSJOIN( [DimDates].[Year].AllMembers,
					   [DimTitles].[Publisher].[Publisher].AllMembers
		             ) ) } ON Rows  -- Displays one row for each publisher with booksales
FROM [CubePubsSales]
GO

-- This statement will display a grid that filters out results for any bookstores that
-- haven't sold any books by using the NonEmpty function. Additionally, to help get a 
-- better idea of how books are selling over time, I've used a crossjoin with the year
-- member of the date dimension that shows how many books were sold by publisher in a
-- given year of sales (as well as a total for all years).
